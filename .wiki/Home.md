# Klipper plugin for self-calibrating z-offset

This is a plugin for self-calibration of the nozzle offset on a 3D printer using Klipper.
There is no need for a manual calibration of the z-offset or the first layer any more (although
this is strongly recommended as a rough starting value). It is possible to change any variable
in the printer from the temperature, the nozzle, the flex plate, any modding on the printhead
or bed or even changing the z endstop position value in the Klipper configuration. Any of these
changes, or all of them together, will not affect the first layer at all - if you use this
plugin.

## Disclaimer

You use it at your onw risk! I'm not responsible for any damage that might result. Although,
this extension works rock solid for me and many others for years now. Always be careful
and double check everything when configuring or working with your printer. And as always,
never leave unattended while printing!
